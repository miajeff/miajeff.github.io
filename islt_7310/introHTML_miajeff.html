    Hello! My name is Mia Jefferson. Originally, I am from Wichita, KS and I currently live in Columbia, MO where I am in my third year at Mizzou. I plan to graduate with my BA emphasis in Graphic Design and minor in IT. Throughout the last 5 years, I have taken both IT and computer science courses on object-oriented programming, front end development, and full stack development. I have the most experience using C, C#, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. I expect to sharpen my front-end skills and focus on also incorporating design into my work. Following this course, I would like to continue designing and implementing projects to add to my portfolio. In addition to building my portfolio, I am also looking to narrow done some career options, so I can focus on developing certain skills. In my free time, I enjoy photography, travel, painting, collecting magazines, biking, going on walks and thrift shopping!
